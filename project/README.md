    # What is program about

    Nicolas Cage is a chameleon of actors, known for his unpredictable and wildly varied film choices. One day, he's Nic the stoic historical figure in "National Treasure," and the next, he's over-the-top Nic in "Con Air," devouring a pyramid of dinosaur bones. This mercurial nature has become a hallmark of his career, leaving fans wondering: which Nicolas Cage are you encountering today? Are you ready to find out which Nicolas Cage persona will show up in his latest project?

    The program is a form of fun in which character played by Nick Cage you are. The Cage class is universal, in the main function you can declare your movies, characters and questions.

    # How program count points

    The program counts points from 0 to 9 and decides which title to choose based on that. You can only use closed questions. If you don't use acceptable forms like 'yes' or 'no' this question won't be count to the score. So bevare!

    # How we choose the films

    For this project we choose only few films we know the best. But feel free to extend titles, characters and number of questions. WARNING: you can have as much points as titles, so if you use more titles than points you should use extra if statement.

    # How I made choises

    In that projet I wanted to check my general knowledge after the course. So I decided to use main class with few parameters. I also used list and tuples todether, before I tried to use doctionary but it wasn't a good choise. I believe that in the future I would like to do the point system more complex, and all decisions more suited to film creations. It is possible to add some images or quotes from films.

    # How to use

    Using of the program is really simple. You need to only open the program and input your name. After that whole magic starts - you need to answer few questions and voila!

    Happy Caging!
